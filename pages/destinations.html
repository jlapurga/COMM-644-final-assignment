          <h2>Bangkok</h2>
          <p>Bangkok is the capital of Thailand and, with a population of over eleven million inhabitants, by far its largest city. Its high-rise buildings, heavy traffic congestion, intense heat and naughty nightlife may not immediately give you the best impression — but don't let that mislead you. It is one of Asia's most cosmopolitan cities with magnificent temples and palaces, authentic canals, busy markets and a vibrant nightlife that has something for everyone.</p>
          <p>For years, it was only a small trading post at the banks of the Chao Phraya River, until King Rama I, the first monarch of the present Chakri dynasty, turned it into the capital of Siam in 1782, after the burning of Ayutthaya by Burmese invaders but they did not take over Ayutthaya. Since then, Bangkok has turned into a national treasure house and functions as Thailand's spiritual, cultural, political, commercial, educational and diplomatic centre.</p>
          
          <h4>Top Sights in Bangkok</h4>

              </ul>
              <div id="t1">
              <img src='../images/Chatuchake%20Weekend%20Market.jpg' class='float-right' style='padding-top: 16px'/>
              <p>Among the largest markets in the world, Chatuchak seems to unite everything buyable, from used vintage sneakers to baby squirrels. Plan to spend a full day here, as there’s plenty to see, do and buy. But come early, ideally around 10am, to beat the crowds and the heat.</p>
              <p>There is an information centre and a bank with ATMs and foreign-exchange booths at the Chatuchak Park Office, near the northern end of the market’s Soi 1, Soi 2 and Soi 3. Schematic maps and toilets are located throughout the market.</p>
              <p>Friday nights from around 8pm to midnight, several vendors, largely those selling clothing, accessories and food, open up shop in Chatuchak. There are a few vendors on weekday mornings, and a daily vegetable, plant and flower market opposite the market’s southern side. One section of the latter, known as the Or Tor Kor Market, sells fantastically gargantuan fruit and seafood, and has a decent food court as well.</p>
              <p>Once you’re deep in the bowels of Chatuchak, it will seem like there is no order and no escape, but the market is arranged into relatively coherent sections. Use the clock tower as a handy landmark.</p></div>
              
              
              <div id="t2"><img src='../images/grandPalce.jpg' class='float-right' style='padding-top: 16px'/>
              <p>Part of the greater complex that also encompasses Wat Phra Kaew, the Grand Palace (Phra Borom Maharatchawang) is a former royal residence that is today only used on ceremonial occasions. Visitors are allowed to survey the Grand Palace grounds and four of the remaining palace buildings, which are interesting for their royal bombast.</p>

              <p>At the eastern end, Borombhiman Hall is a French-inspired structure that served as a residence for Rama VI (King Vajiravudh; r 1910–25). Today it can only be viewed through its iron gates. But in April 1981 General San Chitpatima used it as the headquarters for an attempted coup. Amarindra Hall, to the west, was originally a hall of justice but is used (very rarely indeed) for coronation ceremonies; the golden, boat-shaped throne looks considerably more ornate than comfortable.</p>

              <p>The largest of the palace buildings is the triple-winged Chakri Mahaprasat (Grand Palace Hall). Completed in 1882 following a plan by British architects, the exterior shows a peculiar blend of Italian Renaissance and traditional Thai architecture, a style often referred to as fa·ràng sài chá-dah (Westerner wearing a Thai classical dancer’s headdress), because each wing is topped by a mon·dòp (a layered, heavily ornamented spire). It is believed the original plan called for the palace to be topped with a dome, but Rama V (King Chulalongkorn; r 1868–1910) was persuaded to go for a Thai-style roof instead. The tallest of the mon·dòp, in the centre, contains the ashes of Chakri kings; the flanking mon·dòp enshrine the ashes of the many Chakri princes who failed to inherit the throne.</p>

              <p>The last building to the west is the Ratanakosin-style Dusit Hall, which initially served as a venue for royal audiences and later as a royal funerary hall.</p>
              <p>Until Rama VI decided one wife was enough for any man, even a king, Thai kings housed their huge harems in the inner palace area (not open to the public), which was guarded by combat-trained female sentries. The intrigue and rituals that occurred within the walls of this cloistered community live on in the fictionalised epic Four Reigns, by Kukrit Pramoj, which follows a young girl named Phloi growing up within the Royal City.</p></div>
              
              
              <div id="t3">
              <img src='../images/watArun.jpg' class='float-right' style='padding-top: 16px'/>
              <p>After the fall of Ayuthaya, King Taksin ceremoniously clinched control here on the site of a local shrine and established a royal palace and a temple to house the Emerald Buddha. The temple was renamed after the Indian god of dawn (Aruna) and in honour of the literal and symbolic founding of a new Ayuthaya.</p>
              <p>t wasn't until the capital and the Emerald Buddha were moved to Bangkok that Wat Arun received its most prominent characteristic: the 82m-high þrahng (Khmer-style tower). The tower's construction was started during the first half of the 19th century by Rama II and later completed by Rama III. Not apparent from a distance are the ornate floral mosaics made from broken, multihued Chinese porcelain, a common temple ornamentation in the early Ratanakosin period, when Chinese ships calling at the port of Bangkok discarded tonnes of old porcelain as ballast.</p>
              <p>Also worth an inspection is the interior of the bòht. The main Buddha image is said to have been designed by Rama II (King Phraphutthaloetla Naphalai; r 1809–24) himself. The murals date from the reign of Rama V (King Chulalongkorn; r 1868–1910); particularly impressive is one that depicts Prince Siddhartha encountering examples of birth, old age, sickness and death outside his palace walls, an experience that led him to abandon the worldly life. The ashes of Rama II are interred in the base of the presiding Buddha image.</p>
             </div>
              <div id="t4"><img src='../images/watPho.jpg' class='float-right' style='padding-top: 16px'/>
              <p>You'll find (slightly) fewer tourists here than at Wat Phra Kaew, but Wat Pho is our fave among Bangkok's biggest sights. In fact, the compound incorporates a host of superlatives: the city's largest reclining Buddha, the largest collection of Buddha images in Thailand and the country's earliest centre for public education.</p>
              <p>Almost too big for its shelter is Wat Pho's highlight, the genuinely impressive Reclining Buddha.</p>
              <p>The rambling grounds of Wat Pho cover 8 hectares, with the major tourist sites occupying the northern side of Th Chetuphon and the monastic facilities found on the southern side. The temple compound is also the national headquarters for the teaching and preservation of traditional Thai medicine, including Thai massage, a mandate legislated by Rama III when the tradition was in danger of extinction. The famous massage school has two massage pavilions located within the temple area and additional rooms within the training facility outside the temple.</p></div>

          <h2>Chiang Mai</h2>
          <p>Bangkok is the capital of Thailand and, with a population of over eleven million inhabitants, by far its largest city. Its high-rise buildings, heavy traffic congestion, intense heat and naughty nightlife may not immediately give you the best impression — but don't let that mislead you.

      <div class='row' id='kohLipe'>
          <h2>Koh Lipe</h2>
          <p>Ko Lipe is a Thai island in the Andaman Sea, near Malaysia's border. It's part of Tarutao National Marine Park, which is populated with small islands and known for its coral-rich waters. The island has sandy beaches, including Pattaya and Hat Chao Le. Dive sites in the area include the 8 Mile Rock pinnacle and the Yong Hua Shipwreck. Ko Lipe is home to many aboriginal Malay people, known as the Urak Lawoi.</p>
          
          <h3>Best places to stay in Koh Lipe</h3>
          <p>Koh Lipe hotels can be found for all budgets, and all the modern amenities if you wish to have them. It’s however,  pricey compared to other destinations in Southeast Asia. Koh Lipe is slightly more challenging to do on a backpacker budget, but can still be done. Like most of Thailand prices fluctuate greatly based on the season, if you’re on a budget it would be best to avoid peak season. Several Koh Lipe hotels peak season rates are double the price of their low season.</p>
          <p>Accommodation is available all over the island, but we prefer to stay on Sunrise Beach. Why? It’s the prettiest, biggest, quiet at night, plenty of good restaurants, there are fewer boats, and you can see the sunrise and the sunset (at the top of the beach). We have spent time on all Koh Lipe beaches and listed below hotels in Koh Lipe we’d stay in suggesting accommodation on all three Koh Lipe beaches.</p>

      <div class='row' id='kohPhiPhi'>
          <h2>Koh Phi Phi</h2>
          <p>The Phi Phi Islands are an island group in Thailand, between the large island of Phuket and the west Strait of Malacca coast of the mainland. The islands are administratively part of Krabi province.</p>
          
          <p>Phi Phi Islands are a main attraction to Krabi and Phuket Island, and are widely considered to be amongst the most beautiful islands in the world, recently rocking to fame with the filming of the movie "The Beach" on Maya Bay.  Despite the high number of visitors here, the island is still quite stunning, and the surrounding ocean and islands are still spectacular, although Maya Bay does get abit overcrowded during Peak Season.</p>
          <p>Phi Phi Don and Phi Phi Ley are the largest, and most well known of the Phi Phi Islands. The main island of Phi Phi Don has accommodation, restaurants, dive centers, and a very vibrant nightlife! The other islands are part of the National Park and can only be seen on tours.</p>

      <div class='row popBox' id='phuket'>
          <h2>Phuket</h2>
          <p>Phuket, a rainforested, mountainous island in the Andaman Sea, has some of Thailand’s most popular beaches, mostly situated along the clear waters of the western shore. The island is home to many high-end seaside resorts, spas and restaurants. Phuket City, the capital, has old shophouses and busy markets. Patong, the main resort town, has many nightclubs, bars and discos.</p>
          
          <p>Phuket is a melting pot of indigenous Thais, Thai-Chinese, ethnic Malays and even sea gypsies. The majority of the population in the rural areas is Muslim. Outside of the provincial town, the rural folk speak with a thick Southern dialect which is difficult for even other Thais to understand. The provincial town’s economy having boomed over the past decade has led to a lot of the youngsters leading similar lives to those in Bangkok. Altogether, the lifestyle of the urban Sino-Thais in Phuket resembles that of their counterparts in Bangkok.</p>
